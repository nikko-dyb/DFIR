# Windows Memory Forensics

## üìå Overview
Memory forensics is the process of analyzing volatile memory (RAM) to uncover artifacts related to running processes, network connections, malware, and system activity. It is a critical component in digital investigations, helping analysts detect hidden threats, rootkits, and active intrusions.

## üîç Key Memory Artifacts and Analysis
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

| **Artifact** | **Analysis Method** | **What It Reveals** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Running Processes** | `vol.py -f <dump> pslist` | Active processes and parent-child relationships |
| **Network Connections** | `vol.py -f <dump> netscan` | Open network connections and remote communication |
| **DLL and Code Injection** | `vol.py -f <dump> malfind` | Hidden or injected malicious code |
| **User Sessions** | `vol.py -f <dump> logonsessions` | Active and historical user logins |
| **Browser and Credential Data** | `vol.py -f <dump> chromehistory` | Extracts browser artifacts from memory |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Notice in Memory Forensics
- **Suspicious Processes:** Look for uncommon parent-child process relationships.
- **Hidden Malware:** Memory-resident malware may not exist on disk but can be found in RAM.
- **Credential Theft:** Attackers often use memory scraping to extract plaintext passwords.
- **Remote Access Trojans (RATs):** Identify suspicious remote connections in network logs.
- **Memory Artifacts of Fileless Malware:** Malicious code executing directly in memory without being written to disk.

---

## üöß Limitations of Memory Forensics
- **Requires a RAM Dump:** Live memory must be acquired before system shutdown.
- **Potentially Large Datasets:** Memory dumps can be several gigabytes in size, making analysis time-consuming.
- **Encrypted Memory Sections:** Some regions of memory may be encrypted or inaccessible.
- **Anti-Forensic Techniques:** Malware can attempt to hide itself in memory or overwrite key artifacts.

### ‚úÖ Summary
Memory forensics is an essential technique in digital investigations, providing insights into active processes, network activity, and hidden malware. By using tools like Volatility, Rekall, and WinDBG, investigators can uncover vital forensic evidence stored in RAM. However, challenges such as anti-forensic measures and large dataset analysis must be considered.
