## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Notice in USB Tracking Analysis
- **Unauthorized USB Device Usage:** Identify devices that should not have been connected.
- **Timestamps for Insertions and Removals:** Correlate with user activity to detect suspicious behavior.
- **File Transfers and Data Exfiltration:** Check for file activity logs linked to USB drives.
- **USB Device Serial Numbers:** Can help trace specific devices to users or locations.
- **Usage Across Different Systems:** Identify USB devices used across multiple computers.

---

## üöß Limitations of USB Tracking Analysis
- **No File-Level Transfer Tracking:** USB artifacts do not directly record file transfers.
- **USB History May Be Cleared:** Users or malware can delete registry entries to remove evidence.
- **Limited to Connected Devices:** Only tracks devices that have been plugged into the system.
- **Time Constraints:** Some registry entries may be overwritten over time.

### ‚úÖ Summary
Windows USB tracking analysis is a key forensic technique for identifying connected USB storage devices and potential data exfiltration. By using tools like USBDetective, USBDeview, and registry analysis tools, investigators can track USB activity and uncover unauthorized device usage. However, analysts should be aware of limitations, such as the inability to track file-level transfers and possible log tampering.
