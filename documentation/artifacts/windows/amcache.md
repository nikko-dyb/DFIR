# Windows Amcache Analysis

## üìå Overview
The Amcache.hve registry file is a valuable forensic artifact that tracks executed programs, file metadata, and other system activity. It is essential for identifying program execution and file interactions, even if the program has been deleted.

| **Artifact** | **Registry Path** | **What It Reveals** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Program Execution History** | `C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve` | Tracks executed programs |
| **File Metadata** | `Root\File` | Contains details like SHA1 hash, size, and timestamps |
| **Device Information** | `Root\DriverDatabase` | Tracks installed drivers |
| **Persistence Evidence** | `Root\Programs` | Programs set to auto-run on startup |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Notice in Amcache Analysis
- **Executed Applications:** Identifies software that ran on the system, even if it was deleted.
- **File Hashes and Metadata:** Can be used to compare against threat intelligence databases.
- **Program Install Timestamps:** Useful for forensic timelines and event correlation.
- **Unsigned or Suspicious Programs:** Detect malware or unauthorized applications.
- **Removable Device Executions:** Indicates if a program was executed from a USB drive.

---

## üöß Limitations of Amcache Analysis
- **No Full Execution Logs:** Amcache only tracks metadata, not actual command execution.
- **No Direct User Attribution:** Cannot determine which user executed a program.
- **Log Overwriting:** Older entries may be purged as new programs execute.
- **Tampering and Clearing:** Attackers may delete or modify Amcache entries.

### ‚úÖ Summary
Windows Amcache analysis is a powerful forensic technique for identifying program execution history, file metadata, and system persistence mechanisms. By leveraging tools like AmcacheParser, RECmd, and Volatility, investigators can extract and analyze critical execution artifacts. However, limitations such as data overwriting, lack of user attribution, and possible tampering must be considered.
