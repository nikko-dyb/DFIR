# Windows File Recovery Fundamentals

## üìå Overview
File recovery is a crucial forensic process aimed at retrieving lost, deleted, or corrupted files. This process leverages forensic artifacts such as the **Master File Table (MFT)**, **$LogFile**, and **$Recycle.Bin** to reconstruct file data. Understanding the mechanisms behind file deletion and recovery can help digital forensics professionals recover evidence even after an attempt to erase it.

## üîç How File Deletion Works
When a file is deleted in Windows:
1. The **Master File Table (MFT)** entry remains but is marked as unallocated.
2. The file contents remain on disk until they are overwritten.
3. The **$LogFile** (NTFS transaction log) may retain references to file changes.
4. The **$Recycle.Bin** temporarily stores files before permanent deletion (if not shift-deleted).
5. **Shadow copies** (if enabled) may retain file snapshots.

## üîç Recovering Files Using MFT
The **MFT (Master File Table)** stores metadata for each file, making it a powerful source for file recovery. Here‚Äôs how to recover files using MFT:

### **Step 1: Extract the MFT**
```bash
mftrcrd.exe -i C:\$MFT -o mft_dump.csv
```

### **Step 2: Analyze MFT Entries**
```bash
analyzeMFT.py -f mft_dump.csv -o recovered_files.csv
```

### **Step 3: Recover File Data**
Using **FTK Imager**:
1. Open FTK Imager and load the drive image.
2. Navigate to `$MFT` and locate unallocated entries.
3. Extract file contents manually or via scripting.

| **Method** | **Technique** | **Use Case** |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Shadow Copies** | Restore previous versions | If Volume Shadow Copy is enabled |
| **$LogFile Analysis** | NTFS transaction log recovery | Recover file system changes |
| **RAW Carving** | Extracting file signatures manually | Useful when MFT is damaged |
| **File Carving** | Signature-based recovery (e.g., JPEG, DOCX) | For fragmented or partially overwritten files |

## üöß Limitations of File Recovery
- **Overwritten Data Cannot Be Recovered**: If new data is written over a deleted file, recovery is impossible.
- **SSD TRIM Feature Erases Data Quickly**: On SSDs, TRIM permanently deletes unallocated space.
- **Encrypted Files May Be Unrecoverable**: BitLocker or EFS encryption can render deleted files inaccessible.
- **File Fragmentation Complicates Recovery**: Large or fragmented files may only be partially recoverable.

### ‚úÖ Summary
Windows file recovery relies on forensic techniques to extract deleted or lost files using artifacts like the **MFT**, **$LogFile**, and **Shadow Copies**. By leveraging tools like FTK Imager, Autopsy, and TestDisk, investigators can reconstruct file histories and recover valuable evidence. However, file recovery is subject to limitations such as overwriting, SSD TRIM effects, and encryption barriers.
