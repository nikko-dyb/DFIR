## üîç 1. Overview
Incident Response (IR) is the **structured approach to managing cybersecurity incidents** to minimize impact and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.

### **Key Objectives:**
- Detect and mitigate security incidents **quickly and efficiently**.
- **Contain** the incident to prevent further damage.
- **Recover** affected systems and restore operations.
- **Document lessons learned** to improve future response.
- **Comply** with regulatory requirements and reporting.

**Key Reference Frameworks:**
- **NIST 800-61** (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide)
- **MITRE ATT&CK** Framework
- **SANS Incident Response Process**

## üîÑ 2. Incident Response Lifecycle
### **Incident Response Phases:**
1. **Preparation** ‚Äì Establish policies, tools, and procedures.
2. **Detection & Analysis** ‚Äì Identify and investigate security incidents.
3. **Containment** ‚Äì Limit the scope and prevent escalation.
4. **Eradication** ‚Äì Remove the root cause and clean up the environment.
5. **Recovery** ‚Äì Restore operations securely.
6. **Lessons Learned** ‚Äì Improve security posture based on findings.

---

## üîß 3. Phase 1: Preparation

### **1. Establish an Incident Response Plan (IRP)**
- Define **roles and responsibilities** (SOC, IT, Legal, HR, PR).
- Document **escalation procedures** and key contacts.
- Ensure **management approval** and compliance alignment.

### **2. Set Up Detection & Monitoring**
- Implement **SIEM** (Splunk, ELK, Sentinel) for log collection.
- Deploy **endpoint detection tools** (EDR/XDR like CrowdStrike, SentinelOne).
- Use **honeypots** for early threat detection.

### **3. Conduct Regular Training & Tabletop Exercises**
- Run **simulated attack scenarios** (phishing, ransomware, insider threat).
- Train responders on **evidence handling & chain of custody**.
- Test **communication plans** with key stakeholders.

### **Tips & Tricks:**
‚úÖ Ensure **out-of-band communication** channels (Slack, Signal, secured email).
‚úÖ Maintain **offline backups** of critical data and systems.
‚úÖ Document **all security controls and configurations**.

---

## üîç 4. Phase 2: Detection & Analysis

### **1. Identify Suspicious Activity**
- Analyze **SIEM alerts** (e.g., failed logins, abnormal network traffic).
- Check **host-based indicators** (unexpected processes, registry changes).
- Look for **threat intelligence matches** (IP, domain, hash correlations).

### **2. Gather Logs & Data Sources**
- Windows Event Logs (`Security.evtx`, `Sysmon.evtx`)
- Firewall & IDS/IPS logs (`Snort`, `Suricata`, `Zeek`)
- Network Traffic (`PCAP`, `Wireshark`)

### **3. Triage and Prioritize the Incident**
- **Critical** ‚Äì Active ransomware, APT compromise, major data breach.
- **High** ‚Äì Malware detected, unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Medium** ‚Äì Phishing emails, credential stuffing attempts.
- **Low** ‚Äì Failed brute-force attempts, minor security misconfigurations.

### **Tips & Tricks:**
‚úÖ Use **MITRE ATT&CK** to map attacker techniques.
‚úÖ Automate **log correlation** with SOAR tools (Cortex XSOAR, TheHive).
‚úÖ Maintain a **threat intelligence database** for quick reference.

## üö® 5. Phase 3: Containment

### **1. Short-Term Containment**
- Isolate infected endpoints **immediately** (EDR quarantine, VLAN segmentation).
- Disable compromised **user accounts & API keys**.
- Block **malicious IPs, domains, hashes** on firewall & proxies.

### **2. Long-Term Containment**
- Patch **vulnerabilities** that allowed the attack.
- Reset credentials and reissue **authentication tokens**.
- Deploy **enhanced monitoring** for affected assets.

### **Tips & Tricks:**
‚úÖ Avoid **shutting down infected systems** to preserve volatile evidence.
‚úÖ Utilize **YARA rules** to detect memory-based threats.
‚úÖ Encrypt logs and maintain **chain of custody** for legal admissibility.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 6. Phase 4: Eradication

### **1. Identify & Remove Root Cause**
- Analyze **malware artifacts** with sandboxing (CAPE, Any.Run).
- Remove **persistence mechanisms** (registry keys, scheduled tasks).
- Use **Forensic tools** (Volatility, FTK Imager) for deep analysis.

### **2. Patch & Harden Systems**
- Apply **critical security patches**.
- Enforce **least privilege access (Zero Trust)**.
- Enable **advanced security logging** for detection.

### **Tips & Tricks:**
‚úÖ Use **Sysmon** to track process execution and persistence.
‚úÖ Leverage **Threat Hunting** to detect residual artifacts.
‚úÖ Run **IOC scans** against all endpoints.

---

## üöÄ 7. Phase 5: Recovery

### **1. Restore Affected Systems**
- Verify integrity of **backups** before restoring.
- Rebuild systems from **clean images**.
- Monitor for **re-infection attempts** post-restoration.

### **2. Monitor & Strengthen Defenses**
- Deploy **EDR/XDR rules** to detect **repeat attempts**.
- Conduct **penetration testing** to validate remediations.
- Improve **employee security awareness**.

### **Tips & Tricks:**
‚úÖ Never trust **backups without validation** (verify hash & integrity).
‚úÖ Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for critical accounts.
‚úÖ Review **SIEM rules** to detect early warning signs.

---

## üîÑ 8. Phase 6: Lessons Learned

### **1. Post-Incident Report**
- Document **timeline, affected systems, attacker techniques**.
- Identify **gaps in detection, containment, and response**.
- Summarize **recommendations for future prevention**.

### **2. Improve IR Procedures**
- Update **incident response runbooks** based on findings.
- Conduct a **post-mortem meeting** with key stakeholders.
- Share intelligence with **threat-sharing communities (MISP, FS-ISAC)**.

### **Tips & Tricks:**
‚úÖ Maintain an **incident response logbook**.
‚úÖ Conduct **red team vs. blue team exercises** to refine defenses.
‚úÖ Automate **playbook execution with SOAR**.
